# Boxes

Getting a bounding box of an element is often influenced by context. SVG.js offers various methods to get a bounding box of an element.

All `SVG.*Box`instances have one method in common: `merge()`.

## merge()

`returns` __`itself`__

All `SVG.*Box` prototypes have a nifty little feature. With `merge()`, two `SVG.*Box` instances can be merged into one new instance, basically being the bounding box of the two original boxes. For example:

```javascript
var box1 = draw.rect(100,100).move(50,50).bbox()
var box2 = draw.rect(100,100).move(200,200).bbox()
var box3 = box1.merge(box2)
```
