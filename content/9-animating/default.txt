Title: Animating

Text: 

# Animating
Animating elements is very much the same as manipulating elements using the `attr()` method. The only difference is you have to include the `animate()` method.

## Method chain
Note that the `animate()` method will not return the targeted element but an instance of SVG.FX which will take the following methods:

Of course `attr()`:
```javascript
rect.animate().attr({ fill: '#f03' })
```

The `x()`, `y()` and `move()` methods:
```javascript
rect.animate().move(100, 100)
```

And the `cx()`, `cy()` and `center()` methods:
```javascript
rect.animate().center(200, 200)
```

Or transformation methods:
```javascript
rect.animate().rotate(45).skew(25, 0)
```

You can also animate non-numeric unit values using the `attr()` method:
```javascript
rect.attr('x', '10%').animate().attr('x', '50%')
```

## Easing
All available ease types are:

- `<>`: ease in and out
- `>`: ease out
- `<`: ease in
- `-`: linear
- `=`: external control
- a function

For the latter, here is an example of the default `<>` function:

```javascript
function(pos) { return (-Math.cos(pos * Math.PI) / 2) + 0.5 }
```

For more easing equations, have a look at the (link: https://github.com/svgdotjs/svg.easing.js text: svg.easing.js target: _blank) plugin.

## animate()

`returns` __`SVG.FX`__

```javascript
rect.animate().move(150, 150)
```

The `animate()` method will take three arguments. The first is `duration`, the second `ease` and the third `delay`:

```javascript
rect.animate(2000, '>', 1000).attr({ fill: '#f03' })
```

Alternatively you can pass an object as the first argument:

```javascript
rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' })
```

By default `duration` will be set to `1000`, `ease` will be set to `<>`.

You can chain multiple animations together by calling `animate` again:

```javascript
rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).animate().dmove(50,50)
```

## situation

`returns` __`object`__

The current situation of an animation is stored in the `situation` object:

```javascript
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100)
rect.fx.situation //-> everything is in here
```

Available values are:

- `start` (start time as a number in milliseconds)
- `play` (animation playing or not; `true` or `false`)
- `pause` (time when the animation was last paused)
- `duration` (the chosen duration of the animation)
- `ease` (the chosen easing calculation)
- `finish` (start + duration)
- `loop` (the current loop; counting down if a number; `true`, `false` or a number)
- `loops` (if a number, the total number loops; `true`, `false` or a number)
- `reverse` (whether or not the animation should run backwards)
- `reversing` (`true` if the loop is currently reversing, otherwise `false`)

## target()

`returns` __`SVG.Element`__

The target method returns the element the animation is applied to:

```javascript
rect.fx.target() // returns rect
```

<br>
# Controlling

## finish()

`returns` __`itself`__

This method finishes the whole animation chain. All values are set to their corresponding end values and every situation gets fullfilled

```javascript
rect.animate().move(200, 200).animate().dmove(50,50).size(300,400)

rect.finish() // rect at 250,250 with size 300,400
```

## pause()

`returns` __`itself`__

Pausing an animations is fairly straightforward:

```javascript
rect.animate().move(200, 200)

rect.mouseover(function() { this.pause() })
```

## play()

`returns` __`itself`__

Will start playing a paused animation:

```javascript
rect.animate().move(200, 200)

rect.mouseover(function() { this.pause() })
rect.mouseout(function() { this.play() })
```

## reverse()

`returns` __`itself`__

Toggles the direction of the animation or sets it to a specific direction:

```javascript
// will run from 100,100 to rects initial position
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).reverse()

// sets direction to backwards
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).reverse(true)

// sets direction to forwards (same as not calling reverse ever)
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).reverse(false)
```

## stop()

`returns` __`itself`__

If you just want to stop an animation you can call the `stop()` method which has two optional arguments:

 - jumpToEnd: Sets the values to the end of the animation
 - clearQueue: Remove all items from queue

```javascript
rect.animate().move(200, 200)

rect.stop()
// or e.g.
rect.stop(true)
```

Stopping an animation is irreversible.

# Timing

## at()

`returns` __`itself`__

Say you want to control the position of an animation with an external event, then the `at()` method will prove very useful:

```javascript
var animation = draw.rect(100, 100).move(50, 50).animate('=').move(200, 200)

document.onmousemove = function(event) {
  animation.at(event.clientX / 1000)
}
```

The value passed as the first argument of `at()` should be a number between `0` and `1`, `0` being the beginning of the animation and `1` being the end. Note that any values below `0` and above `1` will be normalized.

Also note that the value is eased after calling the function. Therefore the position specifies a position in time not in space.

## delay()

`returns` __`itself`__

Alternatively, you can call `delay()` which will set a delay in ms before the next animation in the queue is run

```javascript
rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).delay(500).animate().dmove(50,50)
```

## loop()

`returns` __`SVG.FX`__

By default the `loop()` method creates and eternal loop:

```javascript
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).loop()
```

But the loop can also be a predefined number of times:

```javascript
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).loop(3)
```

Loops go from beginning to end and start over again (`0->1.0->1.0->1.`).

There is also a reverse flag that should be passed as the second argument:

```javascript
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).loop(3, true)
```

Loops will then be completely reversed before starting over (`0->1->0->1->0->1.`).

## once()

`returns` __`itself`__

Finally, you can perform an action at a specific position only once. Just pass the position and the function which should be executed to the `once` method. You can also decide whether the position which is passed should be handled as position in time (not eased) or position in space (easing applied):

```javascript
// the 0.5 is handled as uneased value (you can omit the false)
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).once(0.5, function(pos, eased) {
  // do something
}, false)
```

```javascript
// the 0.5 is handled as eased value
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).once(0.5, function(pos, eased) {
  // do something
}, true)
```

The callback function gets the current position uneased and eased.

## queue()

`returns` __`itself`__

If you want to call a custom funtion between two chained animations, you simply can queue them up:

```javascript
rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).queue(function(){

    this.target().fill('#000')
    this.dequeue() // dont forget to call dequeue when the queue should continue running

}).animate().dmove(50,50)
```

<br>
# Callbacks

## after / afterAll()

`returns` __`itself`__

Furthermore, you can add callback methods using `after()/afterAll()`:

```javascript
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).after(function(situation) {
  this.animate().attr({ fill: '#f06' })
})

// or
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).afterAll(function() {
  this.animate().attr({ fill: '#f06' })
})
```

The function gets the situation which was finished as first parameter. This doesn't apply to afterAll where no parameter is passed
Note that the `after()/afterAll()` method will never be called if the animation is looping eternally.
You can call `after()/afterAll()` multiple times to add more functions which should be executed.

## during / duringAll()

`returns` __`itself`__

If you want to perform your own actions during one/all animation you can use the `during()/duringAll()` method:

```javascript
var position
  , from = 100
  , to   = 300

rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).during(function(pos, morph, eased, situation) {
  position = from + (to - from) * pos
})

// or
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).duringAll(function(pos, morph, eased, situation) {
  position = from + (to - from) * pos
})
```
Note that `pos` is `0` in the beginning of the animation and `1` at the end of the animation.

To make things easier a morphing function is passed as the second argument. This function accepts a `from` and `to` value as the first and second argument and they can be a number, unit or hex color:

```javascript
var ellipse = draw.ellipse(100, 100).attr('cx', '20%').fill('#333')

rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100).during(function(pos, morph, eased, situation) {
  // numeric values
  ellipse.size(morph(100, 200), morph(100, 50))

  // unit strings
  ellipse.attr('cx', morph('20%', '80%'))

  // hex color strings
  ellipse.fill(morph('#333', '#ff0066'))
})
```
The `eased` parameter contains the position after the easing function was applied.
The last parameter holds the current situation related to the current `during` call.
You can call `during()/duringAll()` multiple times to add more functions which should be executed.
