## target()

`returns` __`SVG.Element`__

The target method returns the element the animation is applied to:

```javascript
rect.fx.target() // returns rect
```

## situation

`returns` __`object`__

The current situation of an animation is stored in the `situation` object:

```javascript
rect.animate(3000).move(100, 100)
rect.fx.situation //-> everything is in here
```

Available values are:

- `start` (start time as a number in milliseconds)
- `play` (animation playing or not; `true` or `false`)
- `pause` (time when the animation was last paused)
- `duration` (the chosen duration of the animation)
- `ease` (the chosen easing calculation)
- `finish` (start + duration)
- `loop` (the current loop; counting down if a number; `true`, `false` or a number)
- `loops` (if a number, the total number loops; `true`, `false` or a number)
- `reverse` (whether or not the animation should run backwards)
- `reversing` (`true` if the loop is currently reversing, otherwise `false`)
