# Event listeners

## on()

`returns` __`itself`__

```javascript
var click = function() {
  this.fill({ color: '#f06' })
}

rect.on('click', click)
```

**Note:** The context of `this` in the callback is bound to the element. You can change this context by applying your own object:

```javascript
rect.on('click', click, window) // context of this is window
```

## off()

`returns` __`itself`__

Unbinding events is just as easy:

```javascript
rect.off('click', click)
```

Or to unbind all listeners for a given event:

```javascript
rect.off('click')
```

Or even unbind all listeners for all events:

```javascript
rect.off()
```

## other elements
But there is more to event listeners. You can bind events to html elements as well:

```javascript
SVG.on(window, 'click', click)
```

Obviously unbinding is practically the same:

```javascript
SVG.off(window, 'click', click)
```
