Title: Before you push

# Before you push

Imagine that you're tweaking some part of svg.js and as the responsible person you are, you made sure to run `npm test` before pushing. Unfortunately `npm test` tests the current `dist/svg.js` which only has your edits if you first did `npm run build`.

This has happen to me a couple of times and as a svg.js contributor, it's embarrassing.

Fortunately `git` has a `pre-push` hook which can save yourself from the embarrassment.

I have created a `pre-commit` hook that will build a new `dist/svg.js` and run the tests. It's developed on Ubuntu 16.04 but should work on all *nix platforms. You can disable this check with:

```
git push --no-verify
```

**(link: https://gist.github.com/dotnetCarpenter/bb6c2f040e11922cc8f81ef42a8054fd text: pre-commit target: _blank)**

```sh
#!/bin/sh

npm run build:test && npm run test:quick

# check how the test went
testCode=$?
[ "$testCode" = 0 ] || echo "Your current build does not pass our unit tests - please make them pass before you push"
# revert artifacts created during build
git reset --hard $(git log -1 --pretty=%H)
# exit with the test exit code
exit $testCode
```

A failed push looks something like this:
```
git push

## Install ##
Put (link: https://gist.github.com/dotnetCarpenter/bb6c2f040e11922cc8f81ef42a8054fd text: pre-commit target: _blank) in your local svg.js repository, in the .git/hooks folder and make it executable:

```
sudo chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

To disable the check when you push, write:

```
git push --no-verify
```
