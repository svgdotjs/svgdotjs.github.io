# Use

`returns` __`SVG.Use`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Shape`__

The use element simply emulates another existing element. Any changes on the master element will be reflected on all the `use` instances. The usage of `use()` is very straightforward:

```javascript
var rect = draw.rect(100, 100).fill('#f09')
var use  = draw.use(rect).move(200, 200)
```

In the case of the example above two rects will appear on the svg drawing, the original and the `use` instance. In some cases you might want to hide the original element. the best way to do this is to create the original element in the defs node:

```javascript
var rect = draw.defs().rect(100, 100).fill('#f09')
var use  = draw.use(rect).move(200, 200)
```

In this way the rect element acts as a library element. You can edit it but it won't be rendered.

Another way is to point an external SVG file, just specified the element `id` and path to file.

```javascript
var use  = draw.use('elementId', 'path/to/file.svg')
```

This way is useful when you have complex images already created.
Note that, for external images (outside your domain) it may be necessary to load the file with XHR.
