# Compatibility

Our build system transpiles the javasript into a form most of the browsers can understand. For a specific list head over to:
https://browserl.ist/?q=last+1+version+or+%3E+0.25%25+or+not+maintained+node+versions+or+not+dead

However, this settings can be changed if you need to transpile for even older browsers.

SVG itself is supported to a certain degree by the following browsers:

## Desktop
- Firefox 3+
- Chrome 4+
- Safari 3.2+
- Opera 9+
- IE9+

## Mobile
- iOS Safari 3.2+
- Android Browser 3+
- Opera Mobile 10+
- Chrome for Android 18+
- Firefox for Android 15+

Description: SVG.js is compatible with all modern browsers. But for your peace of mind, here is a detailed list of supported browsers.
