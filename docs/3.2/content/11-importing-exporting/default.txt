# Import / export SVG

## svg() _as getter_

`returns` __`string`__

Exporting the full generated SVG, or a part of it, can be done with the `svg()` method:

```javascript
draw.svg()
```

Exporting works on individual elements as well:

```javascript
var rect = draw.rect()
var svg  = rect.svg()
```

You can specify if you only want the content of the element to be exported instead of the element with its contents:

```javascript
var children = draw.svg(false)
```

You can also specify an export modifier which is run on every node before exporting:

```js
var roundedChildren = draw.svg(function(node) {
  node.round(4)
}, false)
```

Nodes can be even removed or replaced in this modifiers:

```js
var tidied = draw.svg(function(node) {
  // remove all shapes with blue color
  if (node.fill() == 'blue') return false

  // replace with circles
  return new Circle().radius(5).fill(node.fill())
})
```

## svg() _as setter_

`returns` __`itself`__

Importing is done with the same method by passing a string of svg as the first argument:

```javascript
draw.svg('<g><rect width="100" height="50" fill="#f06"></rect></g>')
```

You can also import multiple children at once:

```javascript
draw.svg('<rect><rect><rect>')
```

If you want to replace the current elemet with the imported, you can pass a flag:

```javascript
group.svg('<rect><rect><rect>', true)
```

Note, that this call always returns the parent of the element `svg()` was called on. That is, because by replacing a node with multiple others nodes it is not clear which node to return. Thats why the parent is returned.

# Import / export HTML or XML

Svg.js also supports handling html nodes and sometimes you are in need to import or export html.
For this case, you can use the `html()` method that will use the correct namespace on import.

```js
draw.html('<div></div>) // import html
draw.html() // export
```

if you use svg.js to manipulate xml, you can use `xml()` together with a namespace

```js
draw.xml('<my-element></my-element>, myNamespace) // import
draw.xml() // export
```
