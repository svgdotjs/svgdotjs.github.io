# Custom events
You can even use your own events.

Just add an event listener for your event:
```javascript
rect.on('myevent', function() {
  alert('ta-da!')
})
```

Now you are ready to fire the event whenever you need:

```javascript
function whenSomethingHappens() {
  rect.fire('myevent')
}

// or if you want to pass an event
function whenSomethingHappens(event) {
  rect.fire(event)
}
```

You can also pass some data to the event:

```javascript
function whenSomethingHappens() {
  rect.fire('myevent', {some:'data'})
}

rect.on('myevent', function(e) {
  alert(e.detail.some) // outputs 'data'
})
```

SVG.js supports namespaced events following the syntax `event.namespace`.

A namespaced event behaves like a normal event with the difference that you can remove it without touching handlers from other namespaces.

```
// attach
rect.on('myevent.namespace', function(e) {
  // do something
})

// detach all handlers of namespace for myevent
rect.off('myevent.namespace')

// detach all handlers of namespace
rect.off('.namespace')

// detach all handlers including all namespaces
rect.off('myevent)
```

However you can't fire a specific namespaced event. Calling `rect.fire('myevent.namespace')` won't do anything while `rect.fire('myevent')` works and fires all attached handlers of the event

_Important: always make sure you namespace your event to avoid conflicts. Preferably use something very specific. So `event.wicked` for example would be better than something generic like `event.svg`._
