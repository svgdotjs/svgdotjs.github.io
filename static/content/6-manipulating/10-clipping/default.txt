# Clipping


Clipping elements works exactly the same as masking elements. The only difference is that clipped elements will adopt the geometry of the clipping element. Therefore events are only triggered when entering the clipping element whereas with masks the masked element triggers the event. Another difference is that masks can define opacity with their fill color and clipPaths don't.

## clipWith()

`returns` __`itself`__

```javascript
var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10)

rect.clipWith(ellipse)
```

## clip()

`returns` __`SVG.ClipPath`__

Clip multiple elements:

```javascript
var ellipse = draw.ellipse(80, 40).move(10, 10)
var text = draw.text('SVG.JS').move(10, 10).font({ size: 36 })

var clip = draw.clip().add(text).add(ellipse)

rect.clipWith(clip)
```

## unclip()

`returns` __`itself`__

Unclipping the elements can be done with the `unclip()` method:

```javascript
rect.unclip()
```

## remove()

`returns` __`itself`__

Removing the clip alltogether will also `unclip()` all clipped elements as well:

```javascript
clip.remove()
```

## clipper

`returns` __`SVG.ClipPath`__

For your convenience, the clipping element is also referenced in the clipped element. This can be useful in case you want to change the clipPath:

```javascript
rect.clipper.move(10, 10)
```
