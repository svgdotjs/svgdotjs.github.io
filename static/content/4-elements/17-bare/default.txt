# Bare

`returns` __`SVG.Bare`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Element`__

For all SVG elements that are not described by SVG.js, the `SVG.Bare` class comes in handy. This class inherits directly from `SVG.Element` and makes it possible to add custom methods in a separate namespace without polluting the main `SVG.Element` namespace. Consider it your personal playground.

## element()

`returns` __`SVG.Bare`__

The `SVG.Bare` class can be instantiated with the `element()` method on any parent element:

```javascript
var element = draw.element('title')
```
The string value passed as the first argument is the node name that should be generated.

Additionally any existing class name can be passed as the second argument to define from which class the element should inherit:

```javascript
var element = draw.element('symbol', SVG.Parent)
```

This gives you as the user a lot of power. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

## words()

`returns` __`itself`__

The `SVG.Bare` instance carries an additional method to add plain text:

```javascript
var element = draw.element('title').words('This is a title.')
//-> <title>This is a title.</title>
```
