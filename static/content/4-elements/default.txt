# Elements


`SVG.Element` is the base prototype wrapping all elements (or nodes for that matter) in SVG.js. An extra level of refinement is added with `SVG.Shape`. Every element that can take a `fill` and/or `stroke` attribute. It is preferred to extend elements with your own methods on `SVG.Shape`, rather than on `SVG.Element`.
